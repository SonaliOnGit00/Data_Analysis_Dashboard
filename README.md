# Process
## Import & Clean Data
Load raw coffee sales data into Excel.
Clean fields (dates, text, data types), trim spaces, and standardize inconsistent entries.

## Build Pivot Tables
Create pivot tables summarizing metrics like Total Sales Over Time, Sales by Country, Sales by Roast Type, Sales by Loyalty, etc.

## Insert Pivot Charts & Slicers
Add charts (line, bar, pie) based on pivot tables.
Add slicers for interactive filtering by date range, roast, loyalty membership, coffee size, etc.

## Design Dashboard Layout
Arrange charts and slicers thoughtfully: top filters, main KPI visuals, and tables for details (top customers, countries).
Use consistent formatting, bold headings, and color accents for readability.
